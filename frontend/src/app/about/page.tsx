            Welcome to Ratings and Projections, The platform designed to create

            Why I Created the App
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-2xl tracking-tight leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I am big sports fan and I wanted to create a fun site that will keep
            track of players and teams performances and create ratings for each
            player similar to how 2K creates player ratings or bleacher report
            will grade trades. The player grades are determined by player
            performance per game.
          </p>

            Goal of the App
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-2xl tracking-tight leading-relaxed mb-12">
            The Goal is to be able to show accurate player and team ratings and
            show the projections and performance overtime.
